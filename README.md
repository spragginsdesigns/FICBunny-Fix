## What Is FICBunny?

Good question. Simply put, the FICBunny payload is a Firmware Image Creator for the Bash Bunny. 
The script is executed locally on the bunny. It is supposed to create a tar.gz file containing a backup of the bash bunny firmware. 
It also has options to copy the said image to recovery, should a user desire so. 
In some cases, this may be necessary to fix factory reset functions on some Mk2 units.

## Contributions

My goal was to ensure each of the files had a coherent, well-written structure of grammar and wording. Using Grammarly Premium, [Austin Spraggins](https://github.com/spragginsdesigns) structured the files with the appropriate punctuation, grammar, spelling, and more. 

## Conclusion

Thank you to [Hak5](https://hak5.org/) for making the incredible Bash Bunny Mark II. Thank you to [Austin Spraggins](https://www.spragginsdesigns.com/) for all the help in making the files as coherent and structured as possible. And thank you to everyone who uses it and finds it useful.
